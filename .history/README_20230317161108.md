The purpose behind this application was that I wanted to expand my knowledge into one of the Javascripts frameworks and I felt that React was the one that would best serve my progression as a developer.

This project was further built by allowing me to experiment with features that would cross over to any application. It provided me with some practice with applications that would be sued in the real world.

## Application Core Functionality

1. Uses react-router-dom to move between pages, whilst utilizing reacts ability to set fixed components such as my header and footer.
2. useStates allow me to set values to items such as the current inputted email, this is then overwritten using the 'onChange' function in my JSX.
3. Connected to a firebase backend, handles login through both google and email services whilst providing a reset password email when requested.
4. Error codes are presented tot he user when details are inputted incorrectly.

## Lessons Learned

1. How to download packages to improve the quality and readability of my code, such as "Country Dropdown".
2. The complexity of React in regards to creating reusable components, such as the "Header" and "Footer".
3. How to understand documentation so that I can implement features - such as the Firebase documentation for adding the ability to login via google services.
4. The core aspects of react, looking into useStates, and how to export functions between components so that my code remains clean. This extends to understanding the importance of useStates and how they are utilized in all aspects of react, from changing the value of an input to setting values to true or false depending on a button click.
5. Began to further my understanding of promises and how the 'then' method always returns a promise that needs to be fulfilled and allows me to chain the 'catch' method to ensure errors are handled.
6. Understanding the effectiveness of typescript in how it is used to avoid uneccessary errors and improved my overall experience when developing this app. One thing I found in my other projects was that I would make mistakes such inputting incorrect syntax values for my variables.

## Current Features

1. Login using either google or email/password.
2. Reset passwords by sending an email.
3. Creating an account, taking into account details such as location, and date of birth, and accepting terms and agreements.

## Future Features

1. Implementing or expanding this project into a larger project, such as my "School Application" or my "Study Tracker".
2. Expanding error handeling, creating my own error messages that provide an explanation into why an action failed.
