# Login Form

The purpose behind this application was the I wanted to expand my knowledge into one of Javascripts frameworks and I felt that React was the one that would best serve my progression as a developer.

This project was further built as allowing me to experiement with features that would cross over to any application. It provided me with some practice at applications that would eb sued in the real-world.

## Application Core Functionality

1.

## Lessons Learned

1. How to download packages in order to improvie the quality and reability of my code, such as "Country Dropdown".
2. The complexity of React in regards to creating reusable components, such as the "Header" and "Footer".
3. How to understand documentation so that I can implement features - such as the Firebase documentation for adding the ability to login via google services.
4. The core aspects of react, looking into useStates, how to export

## Current Features

1. Login using either google or email/password.
2. Resetting password through sending an email.

## Future Features

1. Implementing or expanding this project into a larger project, such as my "School Application" or my "Study Tracker".
