The purpose behind this application was the I wanted to expand my knowledge into one of Javascripts frameworks and I felt that React was the one that would best serve my progression as a developer.

This project was further built as allowing me to experiement with features that would cross over to any application. It provided me with some practice at applications that would eb sued in the real-world.

## Application Core Functionality

1. Uses react-router-dom to move between pages, whilst utilising reacts ability to set fixed components such as my header an footer.
2. useStates allow me to set values to items such as the current inputted email, this is then overwritten using the 'onChange' function in my JSX.
3. Connected to a firebase backend, handles login through both google and email services whilst provind a reset password email when requested.
4. Error codes arepresented tot he user when details are inputted incorrectly.

## Lessons Learned

1. How to download packages in order to improvie the quality and reability of my code, such as "Country Dropdown".
2. The complexity of React in regards to creating reusable components, such as the "Header" and "Footer".
3. How to understand documentation so that I can implement features - such as the Firebase documentation for adding the ability to login via google services.
4. The core aspects of react, looking into useStates, how to export functions between components so that my code remains clean. This extends to understanding the importance of useStates and how they are utilised in all aspects of react, from changing the value of an input, to setting values to true or false depending on a button click.
5. Began to further my understanding of promises and how the 'then' method always returns a promise that needs to be fullfilled and allows me to chain the 'catch' method to ensure errors are handled.

## Current Features

1. Login using either google or email/password.
2. Resetting password through sending an email.
3. Creating an account, taking into account details such as location, date of birth and accepting terms and agreements.

## Future Features

1. Implementing or expanding this project into a larger project, such as my "School Application" or my "Study Tracker".
2. Expanding error handeling, creating my own error messages that provide an understandable explanation into why a certain action failed.
